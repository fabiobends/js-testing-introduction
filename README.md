# js-testing-introduction
This is a tutorial from Academind about Unit and Integration Testing using Jest, and also E2E Testing using Puppeteer.

In this tutorial I improved my skills using Jest for Unit and Integration Testing, in this video I also learned how to use Puppeteer for End-to-end (E2E) Testing, this repo is based in:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)

Made with :heart:. Consider hiring me as JS tester and developer!
